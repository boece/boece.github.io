# Apple cider vinegar
Vinegar has been found to blunt blood sugar and insulin increases. It is, in fact, able to slow the absorption of carbohydrate into the blood, or slow the breakdown of starches into sugars. Have one tablespoon in warm water before meals with a touch of cinnamon to kick-start digestion and blood sugar balancing. Or simply add it to your salads and other meals.
