I'm going to start this page as a rough draft listing out various ways of increasing traffic to your website in 2019 and I'll update the page as I find new ideas.

Then I'll attempt to execute on these ideas and see if I have any success and I'll document the process
along the way.

I'm just going to list them for now and I'll fill out each one with more detail as I go.

With out further or do here's the list :

# Finding the best hashtags to use on twitter

Use a website like [Hashtagify.me](https://hashtagify.me/) to search for a hashtag you want to use, it will tell you what other popular hashtags are used with that hashtag, this will
help you know what other hashtags to use to increase your exposure on twitter.
You can also discover the top rising hashtags here [Hashtagify.me/Popular](https://hashtagify.me/popular/en)


# Using automation, bots and scripts

Learn to Code! Start writing some scripts you can run on a schedule that direct traffic to your website.

I'm going to work on some scripts that publish my articles onto multiple platforms.

# Instagram bots, auto liking and following people on Instagram
