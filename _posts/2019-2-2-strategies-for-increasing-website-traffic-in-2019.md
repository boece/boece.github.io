I'm going to create this page as a rough draft of ideas for how I can increase traffic to my
website this year and then try and execute on those ideas and document the process a long the way.

I'm going to list them for now and I'll fill out each one with more detail as I go.

I've already realised a lot of these are probably not entirely ethical and involved writing bots and scripts and gaming social media but whatever, everybody needs a hustle.

With out further or do here's the list :

# Posting your articles on social media

# Finding the best hashtags to use on twitter

Use a website like [Hashtagify.me](https://hashtagify.me/) to search for a hashtag you want to use, it will tell you what other popular hashtags are used with that hashtag, this will
help you know what other hashtags to use to increase your exposure on twitter.
You can also discover the top rising hashtags here [Hashtagify.me/Popular](https://hashtagify.me/popular/en)


# Using automation, bots and scripts

Learn to Code! Start writing some scripts you can run on a schedule that direct traffic to your website.

I'm going to work on some scripts that publish my articles onto multiple platforms.
