I'm going to create this page as a rough draft of ideas for how I can increase traffic to my
website this year and then try and execute on those ideas and document the process a long the way.

I'm going to list them for now and I'll fill out each one with more detail as I go.

I've already realised a lot of these are probably not entirely ethical and involved writing bots and scripts and gaming social media but whatever, everybody needs a hustle.

With out further or do here's the list :

# Posting your articles on social media

# Finding the best hashtags to use on twitter posts

Use a website like [Hashtagify.me](https://hashtagify.me/) to search for a hashtag you want to use, it will tell you what other popular hashtags are used with that hashtag, this will
help you know what other hashtags to use to increase your exposure on twitter.
You can also discover the top rising hashtags here [Hashtagify.me/Popular](https://hashtagify.me/popular/en)


# Using automation, bots and scripts

Learn to Code! Start writing some scripts you can run on a schedule that direct traffic to your website.

I'm going to work on some scripts that publish my articles onto multiple platforms.

# Instagram bots, auto liking and following people on Instagram

# Clickbait

Nother unethical strategy but one that seems to work.
What are the various ways of clickbaiting people

* Clickbait titles
* Clickbait thumbnails

# Writing List Articles

Articles that are lists seem to be very popular at getting traffic, for example

* Top 20 Ways to Wash Your Dog
* Top 50 Things That Cured My Eczema
* Top 1000 Ways To Cook A Cup of Rice

I think people like concise articles that get to the point.

# Adding a Facebook Like button to your Blog Posts

Facebook seems to be the best social media platform to infiltrate if you want to increase the traffic to your website, every one seems to have facebook these days, so if you can get a post going viral on Facebook you are guaranteed to get a lot of traffic coming your way.
