I'm going to start this page as a rough draft listing out various ways of increasing traffic to your website in 2019 and I'll update the page as I find new ideas.

Then I'll attempt to execute on these ideas and see if I have any success and I'll document the process
along the way.

I'm just going to list them for now and I'll fill out each one with more detail as I go.
