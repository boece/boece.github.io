## Receive BitCoin and Cryptocurrent Donations
## Direct PayPal Payments

# Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading

Try your hand at online cryptocurrency trading

# Unboxing videos for new products

Buy new products as they come out and do an unboxing video and review the product.

[MarquesBrownlee](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee/videos?sort=p&view=0&flow=grid) is probably the most popular example of that and he would be making millions every year.

# Create a Shopify account

# Sell Reddit Accounts

Apparently there is a market for buying Reddit accounts that have high karma

Consider writing a bot that posts to Reddit and gets karma, figure out a way to get karma so it looks organic, sell these accounts online.

# Setting up a free website on Github

# Text to Speech

Look into ways of generating video from text content.

* Bot script reads product description of newly added products on amazon and reviews and generates a product review video and posts it on youtube with affiliate links to the amazon website.

* Bot reads news articles from websites and generates youtube videos.

These ideas are a bit spammy and probably will get you banned, look into how to limit or quality control the videos so you're less likely to get banned.

# Podcasting and Sponsors

# Collaborating with other content producers

# Create kids videos for youtube

Kids videos seem to get millions of views and the videos seem pretty easy to make, get paid Google Adsense revenue for the views and throw in some affiliate links to sell the toys or products you are using in your videos.

[Ryans Toy Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO_w/videos?flow=grid&sort=p&view=0) has videos with over a billion views and his sells his own line of Toys.
