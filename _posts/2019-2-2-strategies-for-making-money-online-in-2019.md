# Create a Shopify account

# Sell Reddit Accounts

Apparently there is a market for buying Reddit accounts that have high karma

Consider writing a bot that posts to Reddit and gets karma, figure out a way to get karma so it looks organic, sell these accounts online.

# Setting up a free website on Github

# Text to Speech

Look into ways of generating video from text content.

* Bot script reads product description of newly added products on amazon and reviews and generates a product review video and posts it on youtube with affiliate links to the amazon website.

* Bot reads news articles from websites and generates youtube videos.

These ideas are a bit spammy and probably will get you banned, look into how to limit or quality control the videos so you're less likely to get banned.
