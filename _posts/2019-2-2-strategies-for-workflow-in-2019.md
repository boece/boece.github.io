I'm going to create this page as a rough draft of ideas for how I can create a workflow for producing content, videos, publishing content and then try and execute on those ideas and document the process a long the way.

I'm going to list them for now and I'll fill out each one with more detail as I go.

With out further or do here's the list :

# Speech to Text

Is there a good way of recording yourself talking and having that convert to text for easy creation of articles.

# Setting up a Free Jekyll Blog with GitHub Pages

* Hosting a website on Github Pages gives you the following benefits
  * Free
  * Fast
  * Backed up
  * Benefits of source control and pull requests
  * Great for multiple people collaboration

Downsides are you need to have to technical knowledge to use jekyll and git workflow.


# Coming up with a podcasting workflow

* Weekly roundup of what you've worked on or seen online and progress updates for things
you've been working on.

* Can you convert your podcast video to text someway to make it easier for people to find your content. Can you extract auto created subtitles from youtube perhaps?
